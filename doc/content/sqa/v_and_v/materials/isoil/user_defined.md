## User-defined Backbone Curve id=user-defined

A procedure to verify the ability of the user-defined backbone curve to control the stress-strain behavior of the element is presented in this section. The soil was assigned a density of 2000 kg/m^3^ and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The backbone curve was defined as shown in [backbone-input].

To investigate the behavior of the user-defined backbone curve, it was assumed that the element had zero initial stresses, no self weight (i.e., zero gravity), and undamped vibration.

### Results

The hysteresis stress-strain curve in the ZX plane is shown in [user-defined-hysteresis-loop].

              layout={'xaxis':{'title':'strain_zx'},
                      'yaxis':{'title':'stress_zx (Pa)'},
                      'title':'Hysteresis Loop in the ZX Plane'}

              caption=Plot of the element hysteresis stress-strain curve in the ZX plane over the duration of the simulation.

Since the engineering strain in the ZX plane, $\gamma_{zx}$, is equal to two times the tensor shear strain, $\epsilon_{zx}$, it was necessary to multiply the strains output by MOOSE TensorMechanics by two to get the shear stresses, $\tau_{zx}$, which correspond to those defined in [backbone-input]. Next, the engineering shear stress-strain curve was superimposed over those points in [backbone-input], as shown in [user-defined-backbone-curve]. The backbone curve was obtained in MOOSE by sampling the data during the initial load cycle, i.e., from 3 seconds to 4 seconds (see [isoil/problem_statement.md]). It is clear from [user-defined-backbone-curve] that the user-defined backbone curve was consistent with the MASTODON one.

Since the maximum stress in the user-defined backbone curve of 3805 Pa was exceeded during the solve, it can be seen in [user-defined-backbone-curve] that the soil continues to deform without any additional shear stress.
