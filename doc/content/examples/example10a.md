# Example 10a: Cantilever example demonstrating central difference time integration

## Model Description

This example demonstrates central difference explicit time integration in MASTODON. A 2 x 2 x 20 $ft$ cantilever beam is modeled with the bottom surface fixed along x, y & z directions. A uniform normal pressure of 1 $kip/ft^2$ is applied to the top surface along the axis of the model. The resulting stress time-history and displacement time-history are then obtained at locations (0, 0, 10) and (0, 0, 20) respectively and compared with results from Implicit Newmark-Beta time integration.

[fig:ex10a_input] demonstrates the overall dimensions and boundary conditions of the model.

## Modeling in MASTODON

!listing examples/ex10a/MASTODON_Explicit_HEX8.i

The automated meshing option provided by MASTODON is used to create the geometry and specify the element type (see documentation of [GeneratedMeshGenerator](meshgenerators/GeneratedMeshGenerator.md) in syntax for detailed information).

         start=Mesh
         end=Variables

The displacement variables are defined in the `Variables` block. The accelerations, velocities and stresses are defined as auxiliary variables in the `AuxVariables` block.

The `TensorMechanics` action and `InertialForce` kernels are used to model the dynamics of the 3D solid elements. Gravity and damping are not modeled. The AuxKernel, `RankTwoAux` is used to store and output stress-zz.

         start=AuxKernels
         end=Materials

The `ComputeIsotropicElasticityTensor` block is used to create the elasticity tensor of the model, using Young's Modulus and Poisson's ratio. The stresses and strains are calculated using `ComputeLinearElasticStress` and `ComputeSmallStrain`. The densities are assigned to the solid block and the soil using `GenericConstantMaterial`.

The model is fixed along X, Y & Z directions at the bottom surface and an uniform vertical pressure of 1 $kip/ft^2$ is applied to the top surface (see [fig:ex10a_input]).

[CentralDifference](timeintegrators/CentralDifference.md) does not perform a non-linear solve and hence has a simplified `Executioner` block in comparison to implicit time integration.

         start=Executioner
         end=Postprocessors

Time integrators deriving from this class have three solve options, provided via the `solve_type` parameter:

1. `consistent`: (the default) A full mass matrix is built and used in a linear solve for the update.
2. `lumped`: A lumped-mass matrix is built, inverted, and applied to the RHS, which is faster but can possibly be less accurate.
3. `lump_preconditioned`: The inversion of the lumped-mass matrix is used to precondition the consistent solve.

In this example, a fixed time step which is less than the courant limit is specified. Alternatively, the [CriticalTimeStep](postprocessors/CriticalTimeStep.md) postprocessor object can be used to automatically enforce the critical time step when using explicit time integration. `solve_type = consistent` is opted since Implicit Newmark Beta uses a full mass matrix.

## Results

The stress history and displacement history are obtained at co-ordinate locations (0, 0, 10) and (0, 0, 20) respectively and compared with results from Implicit Newmark-Beta time integration (as shown in [fig:ex10a_stresszz_0_0_10] and [fig:ex10a_Dispz_0_0_20]). These figures show that the implicit and explicit results are almost identical.
